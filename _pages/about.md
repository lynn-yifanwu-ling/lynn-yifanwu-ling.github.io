**Hi!**
======

你好 (hello), my name is **<span style="color: #B57EDC;">Yifan Wu</span>**, written as **<span style="color: #B57EDC;">吴怡凡</span>** in Chinese. I’m a second-year Ph.D. student in Linguistics at Cornell University, where I spend most of my time thinking about how we use and interpret language in real-time. My research interests include psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and semantics/pragmatics. Right now, I am particularly interested in questions revolving around imprecision, scalar inferences, and adaptation. I am also interested in applying computational methods to better understand incremental themes. If any of this sounds interesting, feel free to check out my work in the [Publications](/publications/) and [Talks & Presentations](/talks/) tabs above!

I am a member of the [Linguistic Meaning (LiMe) Lab](https://lime-lab-cornell.github.io/) under [Prof. Helena Aparicio](https://lime-lab-cornell.github.io/HelenaWebsite/index.html) and the [Computational Psycholinguistics Discussion Group (C.Psyd)](https://c-psyd.github.io/) under [Prof. Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/).
